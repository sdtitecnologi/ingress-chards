Thanks for installing the ocp-ingress-caixa-chart!

Next steps:
1) Ensure your vSphere values in values.yaml are correct and that the secrets
   'worker-user-data' and 'vsphere-cloud-credentials' exist in the 'openshift-machine-api' namespace.
2) Install the chart:
     helm install ingress-caixa ./ocp-ingress-caixa-chart -n openshift-machine-api --create-namespace
   (IngressController is cluster-managed under 'openshift-ingress-operator' and will be created automatically.)
3) Label routes you want handled by this shard:
     oc label route <name> -n <ns> ingress=caixa --overwrite
4) (Optional) If you set a taint on the dedicated nodes, make sure the IngressController has matching tolerations (already templated).
5) Verify controllers are scheduled on the targeted nodes:
     oc -n openshift-ingress get pods -l ingresscontroller.operator.openshift.io/deployment-ingresscontroller=caixa -o wide

If you use 'domain: caixa.gov.br', only Routes whose host ends with that domain are admissible here.
